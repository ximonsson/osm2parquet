# osm2parquet

Utility for converting OpenstreetMap data files to Parquet. The code is quite messy but it gets it dones at least and I learned some rust =P.

Created this mostly so I could import the data into [duckdb](https://duckdb.org). Based on my crate [osm-rs](https://github.com/ximonsson/osm-rs) for reading OSM protobuf files.
